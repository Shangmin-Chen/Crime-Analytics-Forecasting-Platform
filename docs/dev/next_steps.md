# Feedback

## UI/UX Issues

- **UI Clarity**: After receiving feedback, the UI is not intuitive. It takes a while to understand what is calculated behind the time series and what is just raw data.

## Visualization Improvements

- **Cluster Map**: The cluster map is underwhelming and should be replaced with a heat map instead.
